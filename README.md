# Machine Learning with Python ðŸ§ 

This repository follows a comprehensive Machine Learning course covering both theory and practical implementation. Topics include fundamental learning principles (PAC learning, VC dimension), supervised learning models (linear regression, SVMs, ensemble methods), unsupervised techniques (PCA, clustering), and modern deep learning (neural networks, CNNs). The goal is to build a strong understanding of how learning algorithms work â€” from mathematical foundations to Python implementation using NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
