# Machine Learning with Python ðŸ§ 

This repository follows a comprehensive **Machine Learning** course covering both theory and practical implementation.  
It includes the implementation of key machine learning algorithms, experiments with datasets, and projects exploring different aspects of supervised and unsupervised learning.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong understanding of how learning algorithms work â€” from mathematical foundations to Python implementation â€” using tools like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **scikit-learn**.

## ðŸ§  Introduction

This repository documents my journey through the **Machine Learning** course, where I explored and implemented key concepts, algorithms, and models using Python and essential libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **scikit-learn**.

Throughout the course, I focused on understanding both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical applications** of machine learning.  
The notebooks and code in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Linear and Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- Ensemble Models (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forests)  
- Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Clustering Techniques (K-Means, Hierarchical)  
- Reinforcement Learning Basics

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

By completing this course and its associated projects, I have gained:

- A solid understanding of **core machine learning algorithms** and their mathematical intuition.  
- Hands-on experience in **building, training, and evaluating** ML models using Python.  
- Skills in **data preprocessing, feature engineering**, and **model selection**.  
- The ability to **analyze, visualize, and interpret** machine learning results.  
- Practical experience in applying ML concepts to **real-world problems**.

This repository serves as both a **learning log** and a **reference collection** for implementing and experimenting with different machine learning techniques.
